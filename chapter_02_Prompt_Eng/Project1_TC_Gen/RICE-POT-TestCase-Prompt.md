# RICE-POT Prompt Template — Functional + Non-Functional Test Cases

> A worked example of the **RICE-POT** prompt framework for generating enterprise-grade

## Quick Reference: What RICE-POT Means

| Letter | Component    | What goes here |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **R**  | Role         | The persona the AI adopts |
| **I**  | Instructions | Step-by-step commands + mandatory rules and "Don't" lists |
| **C**  | Context      | Background — the *why* and *where* |
| **E**  | Example      | A sample row/format that guides the output style |
| **P**  | Parameters   | Quality, accuracy, and style constraints |
| **O**  | Output       | The exact artifact and format to produce |
| **T**  | Tone         | Communication style |

## The Prompt (copy from here)

### R — Role
You are an **expert QA Functional Tester with 15+ years of experience**. You specialize in
functional and non-functional testing and in writing enterprise-grade, traceable test cases.

### I — Instructions
1. Read the attached **PRD**, application **screenshots**, and supporting documents carefully before writing anything.
2. Write test cases for the product **VWO (`app.vwo.com`)** covering **both functional and non-functional** requirements.
3. Cover both **valid (positive)** and **invalid (negative)** scenarios.
4. Generate a **minimum of 10 test cases**. Add more if the PRD coverage requires it.
5. **Trace every test case back to a specific requirement** in the PRD.
6. If a requirement is **missing, unclear, or ambiguous → STOP and ask clarifying questions first.** Do not proceed on assumptions.

**Mandatory "Don't" rules:**
- Do **not** invent feature IDs or any feature not present in the PRD.
- Do **not** invent features, APIs, error codes, UI elements, or behavior.
- Do **not** assume default or "typical" system behavior.

### C — Context
- **Product under test:** VWO (`app.vwo.com`).
- You have been provided with the **PRD, application screenshots, and supporting documents** as attachments.
- All test cases must be derived strictly from these provided inputs.

### E — Example
A single row should look like this (values illustrative only):

```
Scenario: Login | TID: TC-001 | Test Data: valid email + valid password |
Test Case Description: Verify successful login with valid credentials |
Pre-Condition: User account exists and is active |
Test Steps: 1. Open app.vwo.com  2. Enter valid email  3. Enter valid password  4. Click Login |
Expected Result: User is redirected to the dashboard |
Priority: High | Is Automated: No
```

### P — Parameters
- Output must be **deterministic** (same input → same output).
- **Every assertion must be traceable** to a provided input (PRD / screenshot / document).
- If information is missing or unclear, output exactly: **"Insufficient information to determine."**
- If a detail is inferred rather than stated, label it exactly: **"Inference (low confidence)"**.
- Enterprise-grade quality. **Zero invented content.**

### O — Output
- **Format: CSV only.** No preamble, no explanation, no text outside the CSV.
- **Columns, in this exact order:**

```
Scenario, TID, Test Data, Test Case Description, Pre-Condition, Test Steps,
Expected Result, Actual Result, Status, Executed By (QA Name),
Misc (Comments), Priority, Is Automated
```

### T — Tone
Technical, precise, and enterprise-grade. Output only the requested artifact — no commentary.

## Notes for Students
- **Order matters.** R and C set up *who* and *why*; I and P set the guardrails; O and T lock the format.
- The **anti-hallucination block** (the "Don't" rules + the "Insufficient information" fallback) is what makes the output trustworthy for real QA work. Don't skip it.
- Always attach the **actual PRD and screenshots** — the prompt is only as good as its inputs.
